To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

PyTorch

torchvision

PIL (Pillow)

NumPy

Matplotlib


This notebook implements a deep learning model using the EfficientNet-B7 architecture for the task of Arabic letters classification. The notebook is structured to provide a step-by-step guide for loading the dataset, preprocessing the images, building and fine-tuning the EfficientNet-B7 model, and evaluating its performance.

Key Features:

Dataset Preparation: Instructions for loading and preprocessing the dataset, including image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques.

Model Architecture: Utilizes the EfficientNet-B7 architecture, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.

Transfer Learning: Leverages pre-trained weights on ImageNet, followed by fine-tuning on the Arabic letters dataset to enhance classification accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics: Includes model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualization.

Visualization: Visualizations of training and validation curves, as well as the confusion matrix to assess model performance.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains images of Arabic letters. The images are preprocessed using transformations like resizing, normalization, and conversion to tensors. The dataset should be organized into training and test sets before running the notebook.

Training Dataset: Located in the data/train directory.
Test Dataset: Located in the data/test directory.
You can modify these paths in the notebook according to your data's location.

Model:

The model is based on the EfficientNet-B7 architecture, a highly efficient deep learning model. The final layers of the pre-trained model are fine-tuned to classify Arabic letters.

Results:

The results of the model, including accuracy and loss metrics, are printed during the training and validation phases. The final predictions on the test set are saved to a CSV file named predictions.csv.

This notebook is ideal for anyone interested in applying deep learning techniques to non-Latin script languages and provides a solid foundation for further exploration and experimentation in the field of handwritten text recognition.
